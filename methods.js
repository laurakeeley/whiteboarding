// 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

// let word = "orange";

// console.log(word.toUpperCase());

// 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

// let num = 302;

// if (num > 100) {
//   console.log("That's a big number");
// }

// 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

// let num1 = 5;
// let num2 = 7;

// console.log(num1 + num2);

// 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

// let word = "purplehippo";

// console.log(word.split("").reverse().join(""));

// 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

// let num = 8;

// let i = 0;

// while (i < 11) {
//   console.log(num);
//   i++;
// }

// 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

// let word1 = "taco";
// let word2 = "cat";

// console.log(word1.toUpperCase() + word2.toUpperCase());

// 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

// let word = "tacocat";
// console.log(word.length);

// 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

// let num = -8;
// if (num < 0) {
//   console.log("that's a negative number!");
// }

// 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

// let num1 = 7;
// let num2 = 10;

// console.log(num1 * num2);

// 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

let word = "orange";

if (word.length > 5) {
  console.log("that's a long word");
}
