# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# puts "Enter a word:"

# word = gets.chomp.upcase

# puts word

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# puts "Enter a number:"

# number = gets.chomp.to_i

# if number > 100
#   puts "That's a big number!"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# puts "Enter a number: "

# num1 = gets.chomp.to_i

# puts "Enter another number:"

# num2 = gets.chomp.to_i

# total = num1 + num2
# p total

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# puts "Enter a word: "

# word = gets.chomp

# puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# puts "Enter a number:"

# number = gets.chomp

# 10.times do 
#   puts number
# end

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# puts "Enter a word: "
# word1 = gets.chomp
# puts "Enter another word: "
# word2 = gets.chomp

# puts word1.upcase + word2.upcase

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# puts "Enter a word:"

# word = gets.chomp

# puts word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# puts "Enter a nubmer: "

# num = gets.chomp.to_i

# if num < 0
#   puts "That's a negative number!"
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# puts "Enter a number: "
# num1 = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts "Enter another number: "
# num2 = gets.chomp.to_i

# puts num1 * num2

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# puts "Enter a word: "

# word = gets.chomp

# if word.length > 5
#   puts "That's a long word"
# end
